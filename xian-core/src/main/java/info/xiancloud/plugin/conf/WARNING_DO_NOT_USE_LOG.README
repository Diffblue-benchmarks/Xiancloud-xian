1、This whole conf part is relied by ReflectUtil.java
In this package including the children you mustn't use ReflectUtil while class is loading: static code block, static fields initialization for example.
Else a class loading dead lock will occur.
2、In this conf package, many methods are relied by LOG.java.
in order to avoid a recursive invocation, you must not use LOG.java to print the log, use the  SystemOutLogger.singleton to print log to std out instead.
